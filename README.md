# AWS Resource Listing Script

## Description
This script automates the process of listing resources in an AWS account for a specified service and region using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). It simplifies the task of auditing and managing your AWS resources by providing a quick overview of the specified service's resources.

## Supported AWS Services
The script supports the following AWS services:
1. **EC2** - Elastic Compute Cloud instances.
2. **RDS** - Relational Database Service instances.
3. **S3** - Simple Storage Service buckets.
4. **CloudFront** - Content Delivery Network distributions.
5. **VPC** - Virtual Private Cloud configurations.
6. **IAM** - Identity and Access Management users and roles.
7. **Route53** - DNS and domain management.
8. **CloudWatch** - Monitoring and logging services.
9. **CloudFormation** - Infrastructure as Code stacks.
10. **Lambda** - Serverless function services.
11. **SNS** - Simple Notification Service topics.
12. **SQS** - Simple Queue Service queues.
13. **DynamoDB** - NoSQL database tables.
14. **EBS** - Elastic Block Store volumes.

## Prerequisites
- **AWS CLI**: The AWS CLI must be installed and configured on your system.
- **AWS Configuration**: Ensure the AWS CLI is configured with appropriate credentials and default settings.

### Installing AWS CLI
If you haven't installed the AWS CLI, you can do so by following these instructions:

```bash
# On macOS
brew install awscli

# On Linux
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install awscli

# On Windows
Download the installer from the [AWS CLI installation page](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
```

## Bash Script (AWS-Resource-List.sh)

### Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Make the script executable (if itâ€™s not already):

```bash
chmod +x aws_resource_listing.sh
```

4. Run the script with the desired service and region:

```bash
./aws_resource_listing.sh <service> <region>
```

Replace `<service>` with the desired AWS service (e.g., ec2, rds, etc.) and `<region>` with the AWS region (e.g., us-west-2, us-east-1, etc.).

#### Example
To list all EC2 instances in the us-west-2 region, you would run:

```bash
./aws_resource_listing.sh ec2 us-west-2
```

### How It Works
The script leverages AWS CLI commands to query specific services based on the user inputs for service type and AWS region. Upon execution, the script will:
1. Check if the required AWS CLI is installed and configured.
2. Parse command-line arguments for the service and region.
3. Execute the appropriate AWS CLI command to list the resources for the specified service.
4. Output the results in a user-friendly format.

## Python Script (AWS-Resource-List.py)

### Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
3. Install any required Python dependencies, if any.
4. Run the Python script using the following command:

```bash
python aws_resource_list.py <aws_region> <aws_service>
```

Replace `<aws_region>` with the AWS region (e.g., us-west-2, us-east-1, etc.), and `<aws_service>` with the AWS service to query (e.g., ec2, rds, etc.).

#### Example
To list all EC2 instances in the us-west-2 region, you would run:

```bash
python aws_resource_list.py us-west-2 ec2
```

### How It Works
The Python script works similarly to the Bash script but uses the `subprocess` module to interact with the AWS CLI. When executed, the Python script:
1. Verifies if the AWS CLI is installed and configured.
2. Takes command-line arguments for the service and region.
3. Executes the appropriate AWS CLI command using the `subprocess` module.
4. Prints the result of the AWS CLI command to the console in a user-friendly format.

## Installation
To install the necessary tools for the Python script:
1. Install Python 3.x, if not already installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Ensure the AWS CLI is installed and configured.

## Notes
- **Both Scripts Require AWS CLI**: Ensure that the AWS CLI is installed and configured with appropriate access credentials before running the script.
- **Service Name**: When providing the service name, ensure it matches the supported services exactly as listed above (case-insensitive). For example, use `ec2` for EC2 instances, `s3` for S3 buckets, etc.

## Troubleshooting
- **AWS CLI Not Installed**: If you receive an error indicating that AWS CLI is not installed, follow the installation instructions above.
- **AWS CLI Not Configured**: Ensure that you have set up your AWS credentials using `aws configure`. You can check the configuration by running:
  
  ```bash
  aws configure list
  ```
